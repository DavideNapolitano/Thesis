*Log Analysis: Topic Modeling applications on fine-features data processing system*
The focus of the thesis is on processing log files produced by computer systems in order to extract the most meaningful features. Following, classical and modern
Topic Modeling algorithms, including my personal implementation, are applied to achieve the best results.
